Any input in the main method that was not an integer would cause the program to crash.
    - Input now has to be an integer that is 1-7
If a room was not in the room list when calling findRoomIndex, the program would crash
    - I added error checking for an empty list and if index was the same as roomList.size
If you added a room with a name that had spaces, it would cause unwanted input.
    - I changed keyboard.next to keyboard.nextLine

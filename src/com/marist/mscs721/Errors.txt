Any input in the main method that was not an integer would cause the program to crash.
    - Input now has to be an integer that is 1-7
If a room was not in the room list when calling findRoomIndex, the program would crash
    - I added error checking so that it returns -1 if the list is empty
    - also returns -1 if the index equals the size of room list
If you added a room with a name that had spaces, it would cause unwanted input.
    - I changed keyboard.next to keyboard.nextLine
You could make a room capacity a non integer value
    - forced integer input for room capacity
If you tried to remove a room that did not exist, it would crash
    - error checked to make sure that the room exists before it is removed
If the input for the timestamp had the wrong format, the program would crash
    - added error checking to make sure the timestamp format is correct before continuing
Made it so you couldn't have a schedule conflict
Made it so if getRoomFromName doesn't find a room, it returns null
